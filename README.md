# elevator-scheduling (OS Project)
Implementation of the scheduling algorithm for a 15-story building with three elevators.
Every time a person requests a floor, the desired floor will be added to the queue and the elevator will start moving according to the order of the floors in the queue.
The request can be internal or external.
Also, the following points are observed in the algorithm:
1) Minimum change of elevator direction
2) Starvation
3) Acceptable response time
